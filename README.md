### Client Side

#### Authentication on Client Side

We utilized a React Context for streamlined management of persistent user authentication, providing a centralized solution that seamlessly propagates authentication state across components in our application. This enhances code organization and efficiency while ensuring a cohesive and secure user experience.

### Server Side

#### Why Authentication (on Server Side)

In our system, we have intentionally foregone a traditional login system. Instead, the application is preconfigured to operate with a single user, utilizing persistent authentication through the Express library. This approach simplifies user interaction, eliminating the need for explicit login procedures, and aligns with the system's design for a streamlined and user-friendly experience. The singular user setup with Express authentication offers a practical solution for our specific application, ensuring security and ease of use without the complexities associated with a multi-user login system.

#### Why JSON

We opted for JSON over a traditional database due to its efficiency and simplicity. The lightweight nature of JSON aligns seamlessly with the minimalistic requirements of the application, facilitating agile development and rapid prototyping. Its flexible data model allows for dynamic adjustments, crucial during iterative testing phases. The ease of integration with development tools and resource optimization further solidify JSON as the optimal choice for our straightforward testing environment. This strategic decision enhances the application's responsiveness and streamlines data management without unnecessary complexity.
